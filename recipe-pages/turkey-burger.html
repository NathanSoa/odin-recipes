    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is the best turkey burger recipe. After making them the first time my husband said 'no more' to beef burgers. 
        These are really good - any cooking method may be used, and they freeze very well. The recipe can also be used for meatballs or meatloaves.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>3 pounds ground turkey</li>
    <li>¼ cup seasoned bread crumbs</li>
    <li>¼ cup finely diced onion</li>
    <li>2 egg whites, lightly beaten</li>
    <li>¼ cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, peeled and minced</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
