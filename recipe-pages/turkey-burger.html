    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is the best turkey burger recipe. After making them the first time my husband said 'no more' to beef burgers. 
        These are really good - any cooking method may be used, and they freeze very well. The recipe can also be used for meatballs or meatloaves.</p>
